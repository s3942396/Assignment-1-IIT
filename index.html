					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p> My interest in IT stems from my enjoyment of video games, VR and AR also intrigue me. I have not delved deep into the how and what of IT rather the interest comes from my enjoyment of  technology. Ever since I had been introduced to It through the Playstation 2, Xbox 360 and the iPad it had become a staple part of my life. As the world is changing and technology is becoming ever more present in our lives, I decided that an IT degree would be best for my future employment along with a solid income.  My experience consists of using technology everyday through playing video games, using an iPhone and using a computer daily. Through school, I did some IT related subjects like Information technology and Reality Bytes, though they were conducted in years 8 and 9.I chose RMIT because it had the course I wanted to do being Bachelor of IT but also I also had the required ATAR score for the course. RMIT also is one of the more popular universities with a good reputation which aided me in picking RMIT. I expected to learn various programming languages, cloud computing and security in IT. </p>

					<h2>Cloud engineer</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p> The role of a cloud engineer is to maintain and support resources through cloud services. Operating and building databases, servers and storage platforms for Chisholm employees to utilise. Maintenance of Chisholm services so they are functioning properly. Improving and developing the ability of Chisholmâ€™s network infrastructure to assist staff and students. Implementation of servers and storage infrastructure spanning multiple campuses and data centres. Assisting Chisholm employees with prevention of disruptions that impact the functioning of Chisholm. The main appealing feature of the job is that it pays well. In addition the demand for cloud engineers and cloud based specialists is increasing a lot, which I can take advantage of. I also find security and hacking quite interesting (due to my tutor making it quite cool). </p>

					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>I currently have none of the required qualifications though I am working towards my Bachelor of IT. I do not currently have any of the necessary experience for the role either. My oral and written communication skills, I would say are adequate though for the role I may have to improve upon them to acquire a proficient level of communication. </p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>Qualifications required for this job a degree in Information systems, Information technology, Computing or Business is required. It is important to be proficient in oral and written communication for this job also. In regards to experience required for this job, a large amount of experience is required in the field of maintaining and improving a massive technical environment. Though it does not specify how long you have to have been in the industry or how much experience exactly is required I can assume at least multiple years of experience working in a similar position or scenario would be required to achieve this extensive experience required for this job. A detailed working knowledge of administration, server environment, Azure infrastructure and multi-tier architecture including caching, web servers, application servers, load balancers and networking. Further understanding is required of me through the use of : </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Office365</li>
						<li>One drive administration</li>
						<li>Exchange 2016 Hybrid</li>
						<li>Powershell scripting </li>
						<li>SAN storage</li>
						<li>Zoning and Fibre channel switching </li>
						<li>ADFS</li>
						<li>Azure AD</li>
						<li>Active directory and Group policy administration</li>
						<li>Windows 2012 R2 server</li>
						<li>VMware and Hyper V virtualization</li>	
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>To begin with I will aim to complete my Bachelor of IT, this should enable me to have some if not quite a lot of experience working with the required tools, programs and services required for the job. If I can even specialise in Cloud computing in the later years of my course it will most definitely enable me to gain experience necessary for the role.Through out the course I will be required to communicate with people which should enable me to hone and perfect oral and written communication for the role. To become proficient in using the other software for the role, I will attempt to learn them on the side of my studies if we are not currently learning how to use them during my course. This will help tick off the requirements as I come to the end of my course. To gain the experience required for the role, I must assume I will have to work in a similar role to gain the onsite environment experience by learning on the job, a similar role at another company would enable me to acquire that experience. An internship would also assist in gaining that necessary experience also. </p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<h3>What does the Myers-Briggs test mean for me?</h3>
					<p>The personality type I got was ISTP-A (Virtuoso). The Myers-Briggs test result depicts me as being highly introverted, which was expected. This would suggest it is more difficult to make friends and interact with new people in comparison to someone who is extroverted. The test shows me as having a higher observant personality, which is that I prefer to look at the world in the lens of the now rather than the future or past. Strengths of this personality type are energetic, optimistic, creative, practical, spontaneous, rational, know how to prioritise, great in crisis and relaxed. These strengths suggest that I am quite enjoyable to be around especially in a crisis situation, I can be level headed, which is useful for a workplace environment. The weaknesses of this personality type are stubborn, insensitive, private, reserved, easily bored, dislikes commitment and risky behaviour. These attributes may make it difficult for people to get to know me and may even make some people dislike me due to the unpredictable nature of this personality type. Overall the Myers-Briggs test means that I have a good foundation for a person in the workplace, though it seems I must work on some aspects to become more well rounded and an easier person to work and be around with. I don't believe this test is completely correct as I can be quite extraverted when around friends and family in addition to me not always being able to be relaxed in a crisis situation. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The project I have chosen to undertake is to make a game. I plan on making it a basic horror game, with a bit of a spin on the concept. The horror game will take place in the wild west era of America in which you play as a cowboy who has been stranded in an empty town with a killer on the loose. Exploring the town will reveal clues on its history and lead the cowboy to meeting the killer. Overall the game will be a standard horror game with an interesting setting which has not been overdone like other settings. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The motivation behind me making a horror game would be it would help develop my skills in coding and game developing which is something I have been interested in for a while. Though there are millions upon millions of horror games available, I would still like to make a horror game as I think it would provide some levels of difficulty to make whilst not being the most difficult game I could try and develop. My main reason for the game would be for entertainment for others in addition to me wanting to produce a game and gain game development skills. </p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The game would be a first person perspective horror game set in the wild west. A mysterious entity has wiped out a town of people. The protagonist is a cowboy and has arrived in the town to spend the night to then set out again. The cowboy will arrive in the town, hitch his horse outside the main saloon and heads on inside. No one is inside the bar, just empty seats and alcohol, so he begins to pour himself drinks. The cowboy downs a few drinks before being startled by his horse crying out for help. The cowboy runs out to his horse, to find it in a pool of blood and its head lopped off. From there the player is able to explore the town in search of clues for what has killed his horse and stranded him in this town. Throughout exploring the cowboy will encounter clues such as notes left behind by victims, body parts, blood trails and the likes. Various places the cowboy will be forced to explore will include a mine, houses, saloon, shops, a desert and a farm area. The narrative will follow a set path, and to prevent that player from going down the wrong path, keys and locked doors will be used. Over the course of the game the player must confront a mysterious entity that has been alluded to from the clues present in the game. The entity will later be found out to be a man enacting his revenge upon the town due to him being exiled prior. The man utilzes a sharpened shovel to murder people in the town, though to the player it will seem he is using some sort magic. During the game the cowboy will encounter survivors who have bunkered themselves within their respective areas. The cowboy will receive valuable information from them which will lead to the finale of the game, in which the player may choose to fight the man or leave unscathed. I will attempt to stylize the game to look old (this may change later) and will feature cut scenes, start menu screen and possibly loading screens. The UI of the game will be limited to mainly an inventory screen and a pause menu, as the game at this stage will not include crafting and the like. An example of a jumpscare that I will include will be when the player enters the abandoned mine and bats come flying out at the player. The mine will be the final area where the killer will be. The game will include eerie music, wild western music made to be scary and in general wildlife/scenery sounds. The game will be set entirely in the night time, and the town will be entirely lit up by small lanterns providing limited light. The cowboy will be forced to carry around his own light source in certain situations. The game will be made to utilise keyboard and mouse inputs, and settings for sensitivity, brightness and audio will be included in the pause menu. </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>To make the game I will most likely be using the hardware of my PC which can run the Unity engine. The Unity engine will be where I make the game.  I will most likely be using pre-made assets from Unity in the game but otherwise I will make my own assets via blender or the likes. Audio for the game I will attempt to make on my own, if not I will use audio from Unity or copyright free sounds. Photoshop will be used to create the UI, pause menu and start screen. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills that are required to make this game will be learning basic C++/ C# coding, understanding of Unity engine, understanding of blender and understanding of photoshop. These skills may be difficult to get but through use of tutorials on Youtube, and other websites I should be able to get a basic understanding of how to create the game. The Unity engine comes with built in tutorials to assist me as well. Coding in C++/C# will be difficult to learn but again tutorials via Youtube will help me program the game, same goes for Blender and making assets for the game, tutorials will be my saving grace. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p> If the project is successful, I would assume that I will have learned many different skills in games design and development. Overall the development of the game wont impact the world or even Australia but it will help me specifically in learning a craft that I am interested in. Thai development of a game will not be groundbreaking in the slightest but will provide a foundation for me if I do want to become a game developer in the future. </p>
